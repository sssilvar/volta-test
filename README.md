# Data Preparation
## The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
URL: https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/

The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database is a widely used resource for the evaluation of arrhythmia detectors and for research into cardiac dynamics. It was developed by the laboratories at Beth Israel Hospital and MIT, and the first distribution of the database began in 1980. The purpose of creating this database was to provide a standardized set of test materials for arrhythmia analysis.

The database consists of 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. These recordings were obtained from 47 subjects who were studied between 1975 and 1979 at the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory. The recordings were digitized at a sampling rate of 360 samples per second per channel, with 11-bit resolution over a 10 mV range.

Technical considerations:
- **Data Format:** The ECG recordings in the database are provided in a **binary** format. Each record consists of two channels of digitized ECG data. It is important to understand the data format to properly parse and analyze the recordings.
- **Sampling Rate:** The ECG signals in the database are sampled at a rate of 360 samples per second per channel. This information is crucial for accurate analysis and interpretation of the signals.
- **Resolution**: The recordings have an 11-bit resolution, which means that each sample is represented by an 11-bit binary value. Understanding the resolution is important for proper signal processing and feature extraction.
- **Annotation Files:** The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database includes reference annotations for each beat in the recordings. These annotations are provided by cardiologists and are stored in separate annotation files. The annotations are essential for training and evaluating arrhythmia detection algorithms.
